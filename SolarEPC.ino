// Dave Davies @dodavies This code runs in my own board as a charge rate controller for use with a Rolec/Mainline EPC
// Huge credit to @openenergymonitor & other contributors without them this would not be possible, buy lots of boards from them :-)
// You can find full details on the project at openenergymonitor.org
// This code will work in an emontx2 and is expecting to see data from an emontx3 on id9
// My dedicated board has a 'parallelling' output which allows you to half the resistance seen on the EPC terminals
// The documentation suggests anything under 50 ohms will cause shutdown of the charger,the wiper resistance is about 40 ohms
// so using the two jumpers allows 20ohms which will shut the charger down but I found no jumpers works fine.
